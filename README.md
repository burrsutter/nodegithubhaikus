# Haikus for Github


This is a quick node project template was originally for [demoing Codespaces](https://github.com/2percentsilk/haikus-for-codespaces)

Now it is for my playing with Github Actions & Workflows

It is based off of the [Azure node sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/nodejs-docs-hello-world). It's great!!!
